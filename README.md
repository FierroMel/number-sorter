Sort user-input integers using Collection framework

This project reads a list of integers from the scanned user-input and saves them into data structures (LinkedList for the first version and Stack for the second version).
The numbers then will be sorted using Java Collections framework.

The program will keep asking the user for numbers until q is entered. The output will be all the number inputted, sorted from smallest to largest.
